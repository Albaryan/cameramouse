# Camera Mouse

    I have made this software to improve myself at image processing. By doing that, 
    I learnt some other libraries and tecniques to make the software run faster.



## Used Libraries

    pyautogui   - Used for getting computer's resolution
    cv2         - Used for image processing
    mediapipe   - Used for hand recognition
    time        - Used for FPS calculation
    math        - Used for mathematical calculations
    numpy       - Used for matrix operations
    mouse       - Used for mouse control

## How to Use

    After running, camera capture will open. There will be a selected rectangular area. 
    That area is the movement area.
    Preffered hand size is 2/3 of movement area.

    # To Move:              Stick index finger to middle finger and move hand in the ractangular area. 
                            If fingers are seperated, mouse will not move.
